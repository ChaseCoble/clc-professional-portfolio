This project was built with Create React App. It is a professional portfolio built on a provided 
back-end. It includes all professional information in a detailed and aesthetically pleasing 
fashion. I utilized as much of native React JS as possible to learn more about the framework. This includes state management through hooks, memoization with hooks, and utilizing string formatters coded in vanilla javascript. This will also provide my public facing aspect of my currently in-design project for a personal work flow app.
